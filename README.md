# newickCoalTimes
Parsing the newick tree format to get the coalescence times

The file coal_times.py contains some functions allowing to get the full
coalescence tree (i.e. all the values of the coalescence times) from
the output of a given ms command. In order to do this, we parse the
newick format.

We need a working version of the ms software (not included in the repository)
